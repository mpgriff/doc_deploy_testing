# Welcome to anemone

Would you like to run transient electromagnetic simulations in python like this:
```python
dbdt = fwr(resistivity, thickness)
```
With a few lines of setup particular to your instrumentation, it can be that easy.

## Intro

Anemone is an open source electromagnetics simulator for 1-dimensional earth models.
Anemone is built with [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), allowing for highly-parallel forward simulations leveraging GPUs.

A priority for anemone is flexibility and readability.

As with many other 1d EM codes, [Ward and Hohmann 1988](https://doi.org/10.1190/1.9781560802631.ch4
) is an indispensable reference. 
Where relevant, references to the W&H are included in the doc-strings of functions. The same is true for equations from other papers listed below.
